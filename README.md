# Learning PyTorch
This is a repository archiving various tutorials I am following to get familiar with the PyTorch interface.

## Current tutorials:
### 60MinBlitz
__Origin__: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

__Status__: Abandoned

__Thoughts__: This tutorial series is quite basic, but fails to explain much of the syntax. Being familiar with the conceptual foundations of deep learning was helpful, but I found many of the explanations online to be lacking as well. Overall, I do not recommend

### Sentdex
__Origin__: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh

__Status__: Completed

__Thoughts__: Overall a helpful introduction to using pytorch to build a neural network and convolutional neural network. In particular the use of a custom dataset and working through building that helped me navigate some of the issues that arose.

### pytorchOfficial
__Origin__: Pytorch official documentation

__Status__: In progress

__Thoughts__: To come 

### pythonEngineer
__origin__: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4

__Status__: In progress

__Thoughts__: Although I am still working through this one, I have found it to be the most helpful. It has done an outstanding job at connecting my theoretical intuition/understanding to the pytorch syntax.
