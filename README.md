# Learning PyTorch
This is a repository archiving various tutorials I am following to get familiar with the PyTorch interface.

## Current tutorials:
### 60MinBlitz
__Origin__: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

__Status__: Abandoned

__Thoughts__: This tutorial series is quite basic, but fails to explain much of the syntax. Being familiar with the conceptual foundations of deep learning was helpful, but I found many of the explanations online to be lacking as well.

### Sentdex
__Origin__: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh

__Status__: In progress

__Thoughts__: To come
