# From Scratch
This is where I try to move beyond only tutorials and build some "historically" (or contemporaneously) important CNN architectures. 

Because I still have a lot of trepidations about building networks (even though they're really not all that bad), I found an example of someone building them from scratch [here](https://blog.paperspace.com/writing-cnns-from-scratch-in-pytorch/).
